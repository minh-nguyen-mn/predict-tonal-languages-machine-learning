# Music as a Mirror: Predicting Tonal Languages with Machine Learning

Tonal languages utilize pitch variations alongside consonants and vowels to convey meaning, making them unique in their phonetic structure. While traditionally studied through a linguistic lens, their musical dimension remains underexplored. This research investigates the intersection of music and tonal languages by employing machine learning techniques to predict whether a song is in a tonal language based on pitch variations. Hypothesizing that songs in tonal languages exhibit distinct pitch patterns compared to non-tonal languages, we collected and analyzed a diverse dataset of 125 songs from various regions, languages, genres, and time periods. Using audio processing and feature engineering, we extracted pitch-related features and trained multiple classification models. Our best-performing model, Logistic Regression, achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 0.65, and generalization to new data was confirmed with a test accuracy of 0.64. These findings highlight the potential of using musical attributes to study linguistic phenomena and suggest applications in language education, speech recognition, and automated language identification systems. Despite dataset limitations and the labor-intensive data collection process, this study paves the way for further interdisciplinary research at the nexus of linguistics, music, and machine learning.
